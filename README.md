# PSUFinancial
What the project does?
This project demonstrates a simple example of pulling data from multiple sources, processing the data, creating a MongoDB connection, and importing data into a MongoDB. The Jupyter notebook was deployed on a Jetstream2 virtual machine using a docker mongo container.

Why the project is useful?
This project would be a starting point for someone wanting to learn how to pull data from Kaggle and yFinance. The MongoDB integration may also be useful for someone wanting to explore more of MongoDB and how this technology could enhance a project or workflow.

How users can get started with the project?
While this project was deployed on a virtual machine, most of the code should work when running Jupyter notebooks locally. The easiest way for someone to get started would be to use Anaconda.
